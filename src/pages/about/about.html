A warm welcome, and thank you for joining the Walking in Hózhó community!
</p>

<p >
  We are a team of psychologists, computer scientists and clinicians in Flagstaff, Arizona, who
  share a passion for type 2 diabetes prevention. We have joined together to serve the Navajo
  community to develop the Walking in Hózhó mobile platform.

<p >
  With Walking in Hózhó, we seek to empower and support Navajo individuals in their journey
  toward harmony, beauty, and well-being. Our mission is to better understand your experiences
  with eating and physical activity, in order to support your healthy choices in a personally
  meaningful way. Thank you for joining us, and do not hesitate to contact us with any questions
  or comments (natalia.dmitrieva@nau.edu).
